# Agent Coder


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

AgentCoder is a multi-agent framework designed to enhance code
generation by leveraging three distinct roles to streamline the coding
and validation process. This implementation is directly derived from the
paper *“AgentCoder: Multi-Agent Code Generation with Effective Testing
and Self-Optimization”*(Huang et al. 2024), with some minor
modifications to the prompts to optimize its functionality within
LangGraph.

### **Key Features of AgentCoder**

1.  **Three Roles**:
    - **Programmer**: Responsible for generating code based on
      requirements.
    - **Test Designer**: Generates comprehensive, independent test cases
      without being influenced by the program code. The test cases cover
      basic ones, edge cases, and large scale test cases, testing for
      performance.
    - **Test Executor**: A program (not an LLM persona) that runs the
      tests and provides feedback for further code refinement.
2.  **Independent Test Creation**: Ensures objectivity and enhances the
    reliability of generated tests.
3.  **Iterative Improvement**: Refines code through multiple iterations
    based on test feedback until all tests pass.

### **Notebook Objectives**

- Illustrate the implementation of the AgentCoder framework using
  LangGraph.
- Showcase the use of **Checkpointer (Memory)** in LangGraph to access
  the state of an executed graph.
- Direct derivation of the implementation from the research paper, with
  minor modifications to the prompts.

## Setup

## Prompts

We start with writing down the relevant prompts. They are copy-pasted
from the appendix of the paper.

# Programmer Prompt
coder_prompt = textwrap.dedent(
    """
    **Role**: You are a software programmer. 
    
    **Task**: As a programmer, you are required to complete the function. Use a Chain-of-Thought approach to break down the problem, create pseudocode, and then write the code in Python language. Ensure that your code is efficient, readable, and well-commented. For example: 
    
    **Input Prompt**: 
    ```python 
    {prompt}
    # TODO: Implement the logic to determine if any two numbers are closer than the threshold pass 

    # Add your code here to complete the function
    ```
    **Instructions**: 
    1. **Understand and Clarify**: Make sure you understand the task. 
    2. **Algorithm/Method Selection**: Decide on the most efficient way. 
    3. **Pseudocode Creation**: Write down the steps you will follow in pseudocode. 
    4. **Code Generation**: Translate your pseudocode into executable Python code.

response = textwrap.dedent(
    '''
    As a software developer, I'll follow the Chain-of-Thought approach outlined in the prompt to complete the `has_close_elements` function. Let's break it down into the four steps: 
    
    1. **Understand and Clarify**: 
    - The task is to write a function that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer to each other than a specified threshold. 
    - The function should return `True` if such a pair exists, otherwise `False`. 
    
    2. **Algorithm/Method Selection**: 
    - A straightforward way to solve this would be to compare each number with every other number in the list. 
    - We can use a nested loop where each number is compared to every number that comes after it in the list. 
    - The absolute difference between each pair will be calculated and compared to the threshold. 
    
    3. **Pseudocode Creation**: 
    ```
    function has_close_elements(numbers, threshold): 
        loop through each number in the list (i) 
            for each number, loop through the remaining numbers in the list (j) 
                if the absolute difference between numbers[i] and numbers[j] is less than or equal to the threshold 
                    return True 
    if no such pair is found, return False 
    ``` 
    
    4. **Code Generation**: 
    - Translate the pseudocode into Python code. Only implement the function. DO NOT add any test cases or explanations. 
    Return the python implementation of the function within triple quotes. Here's a complete example: 
    ```python 
    from typing import List 
    
    def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool: 
        """ 
        Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold. 
        
        >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) 
        False 
        >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) 
        True 
        """ 
        # Loop through each number in the list 
        for i in range(len(numbers)): 
            # For each number, loop through the remaining numbers 
            for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)): 
                # If the absolute difference is less than or equal to the threshold, return True 
                if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold: 
                    return True 
                    
        # If no such pair is found, return False

## Runnables

The LangChain [Runnable
interface](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/runnables/)
provides a flexible and composable abstraction for building and chaining
operations, including models, prompts, and tools. The Runnables will
then be executed in the LangGraph nodes.

LLM = ChatOpenAI(
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    temperature=0.0,
)
```

</details>

The Programmer’s prompt template includes both the instruction and a
one-shot example. Later, the prompt will include the chat-history as
context.

        MessagesPlaceholder("messages", optional=True),
    ],
    input_variables=["prompt", "messages"],
)
```

Additionally, we crate a [Trustcall
Runnable](https://github.com/hinthornw/trustcall) `tests`. Trustcall is
a Python package that enhances the generation of JSON schemas from LLM
responses.

## Run the Agent

Execute the graph in streaming mode and render the messages. We use the
‘values’ streaming mode, which retains the entire chat history at each
step. To focus on updates, only the most recent message is displayed. As
input we pick an example of the
[HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval)(Chen et al. 2021) test
set.

    Let's break down the task of implementing the `truncate_number` function using the Chain-of-Thought approach.

    1. **Understand and Clarify**: 
       - The function is supposed to take a positive floating-point number and return its decimal part. 
       - The decimal part is defined as the difference between the original number and its integer part.

    2. **Algorithm/Method Selection**: 
       - To get the integer part of a floating-point number, we can use the `int()` function, which truncates the decimal part.
       - The decimal part can then be calculated by subtracting the integer part from the original number.

    3. **Pseudocode Creation**: 
    ```
    function truncate_number(number):
        if number is not positive:
            raise an error (or handle it as needed)
        integer_part = int(number)  # Get the integer part
        decimal_part = number - integer_part  # Calculate the decimal part
        return decimal_part  # Return the decimal part
    ```

    4. **Code Generation**: 
    - Now, let's translate the pseudocode into Python code. Here's the complete implementation of the function:

    ```python
    def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
        """ 
        Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
        an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
        (leftover part always smaller than 1).

        Return the decimal part of the number.
        
        >>> truncate_number(3.5)
        0.5
        """
        # Ensure the number is positive
        if number < 0:
            raise ValueError("The number must be positive.")
        
        # Get the integer part of the number
        integer_part = int(number)
        
        # Calculate the decimal part
        decimal_part = number - integer_part
        
        # Return the decimal part
        return decimal_part
    ```

    This implementation is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that the function behaves as expected while also handling the case where the input number is not positive.

    ================================== Ai Message ==================================

    The issue you're encountering is due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic in Python (and most programming languages). When performing arithmetic operations with floating-point numbers, small precision errors can occur, leading to unexpected results.

    To address this, we can use the `math.modf()` function, which returns the fractional and integer parts of a floating-point number as a tuple. This method is more reliable for extracting the decimal part without introducing floating-point inaccuracies.

    Let's revise the `truncate_number` function accordingly:

    1. **Understand and Clarify**: 
       - We need to ensure that we accurately extract the decimal part of a floating-point number without losing precision.

    2. **Algorithm/Method Selection**: 
       - Use `math.modf()` to separate the integer and decimal parts of the number.

    3. **Pseudocode Creation**: 
    ```
    function truncate_number(number):
        if number is not positive:
            raise an error (or handle it as needed)
        fractional_part, integer_part = math.modf(number)  # Get both parts
        return fractional_part  # Return the decimal part
    ```

    4. **Code Generation**: 
    - Now, let's implement the revised function in Python:

    ```python
    import math

    def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
        """ 
        Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
        an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
        (leftover part always smaller than 1).

        Return the decimal part of the number.
        
        >>> truncate_number(3.5)
        0.5
        >>> truncate_number(1e10 + 0.9999)
        0.9999
        >>> truncate_number(2.999999)
        0.999999
        """
        # Ensure the number is positive
        if number < 0:
            raise ValueError("The number must be positive.")
        
        # Use math.modf to get the fractional and integer parts
        fractional_part, integer_part = math.modf(number)
        
        # Return the decimal part (fractional part)
        return fractional_part
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    - The `math.modf()` function splits the number into its fractional and integer parts, which helps avoid precision issues that arise from manual subtraction.
    - The function now accurately returns the decimal part of the number, even for large and precise floating-point values.

    This implementation should pass all the tests, including edge cases and large float scenarios.

    ================================== Ai Message ==================================

    It seems that the `math` module is still not being recognized, which suggests that the import statement might not be executed in the environment where the tests are being run. However, let's ensure that we have a robust solution that does not rely on the `math` module and can handle floating-point precision issues effectively.

    Instead of using `math.modf()`, we can manually calculate the integer and decimal parts using basic arithmetic. This approach will also help avoid any potential issues with floating-point precision.

    Here’s the revised implementation of the `truncate_number` function without using the `math` module:

    ```python
    def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
        """ 
        Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
        an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
        (leftover part always smaller than 1).

        Return the decimal part of the number.
        
        >>> truncate_number(3.5)
        0.5
        >>> truncate_number(1e10 + 0.9999)
        0.9999
        >>> truncate_number(2.999999)
        0.999999
        >>> truncate_number(0.0001)
        0.0001
        >>> truncate_number(5.0)
        0.0
        >>> truncate_number(10.25)
        0.25
        >>> truncate_number(0.75)
        0.75
        """
        # Ensure the number is positive
        if number < 0:
            raise ValueError("The number must be positive.")
        
        # Get the integer part by truncating the number
        integer_part = int(number)
        
        # Calculate the decimal part
        decimal_part = number - integer_part
        
        # Return the decimal part
        return decimal_part
    ```

    ### Explanation:
    - **Integer Part Calculation**: We use `int(number)` to get the integer part, which effectively truncates the decimal portion.
    - **Decimal Part Calculation**: We subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.
    - **No External Dependencies**: This implementation does not rely on the `math` module, which should eliminate the import-related errors.

    ### Testing:
    This implementation should pass all the tests, including edge cases and large float scenarios. You can run the tests again to verify that the function behaves as expected.

Last, we access the final implementation and run it against the
HumanEval test cases.

``` python
# Access the final state of the graph
state = coder.get_state(thread)

# Run tests on the final implementation
exec(state.values["code"][-1] + problem["test"] +
     f"\ncheck({problem['entry_point']})")

print(f'Tests ran successful after {len(state.values["code"])} iterations!')
```

    Tests ran successful after 4 iterations!
