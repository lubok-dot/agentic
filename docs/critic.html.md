# The Critic


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

The [CRITIC framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738)(Gou et al.
2024) is designed to enhance the reliability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by incorporating a human-like verify-then-correct approach. It
leverages external tools to validate and iteratively refine outputs
generated by LLMs. This framework addresses common issues such as
hallucinations, faulty reasoning, and toxicity in LLM-generated content.
In the subsequent notebook we focus on Question-Answering and
Mathematical Reasoning.

### Key Features

1.  **Verification:** External tools critique the LLM’s generated output
    for accuracy and consistency.
2.  **Correction:** The LLM uses feedback from the critiques to improve
    its output.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** The process repeats until the output
    satisfies predefined criteria.

### Applications

- **Free-form Question Answering:** Improves truthfulness and factual
  accuracy by querying a search engine.
- **Mathematical Reasoning:** Solves Mathematical problems by
  translating them into Python code which is then executed in a confined
  environment.

## Setup

## Prompts

The attribute *p* of the state of the Critic Agent.

```` python
p = SystemMessage(
    textwrap.dedent(
        """
    Perform the tasks of question answering and mathematical problem solving by interacting with the Internet via TavilySearch and executing Python code respectively. Use TavilySearch for context retrieval in free-form question answering and Python code for mathematical problem synthesis. Align the approaches with the AmbigNQ and GSMK8 datasets.

    # Task Descriptions

    1. **Question Answering:**
       - Retrieve context using TavilySearch to search the Internet and to provide accurate answers to factual questions.
       - Focus on truthfulness and plausibility checks during verification.

    2. **Mathematical Problem Solving:**
       - Generate Python code execution to solve mathematical problems effectively.
       - Run the Python Code by Calling the RIZA Code Interpreter. Ensure that your final result is printed. That is, the generated code should always end with a print statement ```print(...)``` which prints the final result.
       - Ensure the correctness of calculations and consider plausible reasoning before final conclusions.

    # Steps

    1. **Input Processing**: Given a query, determine whether it is a factual question or a mathematical problem.
    2. **Context Retrieval/Execution**:
       - For factual questions, utilize the Internet to extract relevant information.
       - For mathematical problems, generate Python code and execute it to derive the answer.
    3. **Verification and Correction**:
       - Verify factual information retrieved from the Internet using TavilySearch to ensure it is up-to-date and correct.
       - Verify mathematical solutions by evaluating the Python execution for accuracy and logical consistency.
    4. **Generate Answer**: Conclude with a verified answer, ensuring that any corrections have been applied based on the verification steps.

    # Output Format

    - **Response Type**: Structured text with a clear final answer.
    - **Formatting**: For factual answers, provide the main conclusion last. For mathematical solutions, display the final numeric answer only.

    # Examples

    1. **Question Answering Example**:

       - **Input**: Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice?
       
       - **Process**:

         Proposed Answer: 
            Let’s think step by step. Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act with one person and one instrument. Wolf Alice is a band with four
            people and multiple instruments. So Wolf Alice has a higher instrument to person ratio. So the answer is: Wolf Alice. What’s 
            the problem with the above answer?

         1. Plausibility:
            The question asks for a name, and the answer "Wolf Alice" is a name. So it’s plausible.
         2. Truthfulness:
            Let’s search the question in the Internet:
            > Search Query: Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice?
            > Evidence: [nlpproject2023/Sentences - Datasets at Hugging Face] ...Wolf Alice are a four-piece alternative rock band from... The evidence suggests that Wolf Alice is a four-piece alternative rock band.
            Let’s search the proposed answer in the Internet:
            > Search Query: Badly Drawn Boy is a solo instrument.
            > Evidence: act with one person and one
            [Badly Drawn Boy - TavilySearch] Singer-songwriter - Guitar, vocals, bass, drums, percussion, banjo, piano, keyboards, harmonica - 1995-present... Missing: act | Must include: act The evidence suggests that 
            Badly Drawn Boy is a singer-songwriter with multiple instruments. We need to find out the instrument to person ratio of both acts.
            > Search Query: What is the instrument to Boy?
            > Evidence: [Badly Drawn Boy - TavilySearch] person ratio of Badly Drawn ... consisted of Matt Wardle
            (keyboards/vocals), Robin File (guitar), Sean McCann (bass guitar) latterly replaced by the ex-Smiths bass guitarist Andy Rourke, Dave Verner (drums).
            The evidence suggests that the instrument to person ratio of Badly Drawn Boy is 4:1.
            > Search Query: > Evidence: What is the instrument to person ratio of Wolf Alice?
            [Wolf Alice - TavilySearch] ...Formed in 2010 as an acoustic duo comprising singer Ellie Rowsell and guitarist Joff Oddie, Wolf Alice have also featured bassist Theo Ellis and drummer Joel Amey since 2012...
            The evidence suggests that the instrument to person ratio of Wolf Alice is 1:1.
            The proposed answer is incorrect since Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio than Wolf Alice.

         Question: Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice?
         Here’s the most possible answer: Let’s think step by step. Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act with four people and multiple instruments. Wolf Alice is a band with four people and one instrument. So Badly Drawn
         Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio. So the answer is: Badly Drawn Boy.

       - **Output**: Badly Drawn Boy

    2. **Mathematical Problem Solving Example**:

       - **Input**: Generally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-
                  old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth
                  year, the avocado tree doesn’t produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. How many
                  total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?
       
       - **Process**:
         ```python
         initial_fruits = 50
         num_of_fruits_in_6th_year = 3 * initial_fruits
         num_of_fruits_in_7th_year = 7 * initial_fruits
         num_of_fruits_in_8th_year = num_of_fruits_in_10th_year - 200
         num_of_fruits_in_10th_year = 20 * initial_fruits
         answer = initial_fruits + num_of_fruits_in_6th_year + num_of_fruits_in_7th_year + num_of_fruits_in_8th_year + num_of_fruits_in_10th_year
         print(answer)  # Ensure the final result is explicitly printed
         ```

         Execution: NameError("name ’num_of_fruits_in_10th_year’ is not defined")
         Output: answer = None

         What’s the problem with the above code?
         1. The above code causes the "NameError" because it use the variable ‘num_of_fruits_in_10th_year‘ before it is defined.
         2. The order of the calculation is not correct, ‘num_of_fruits_in_8th_year‘ should be calculated after ‘num_of_fruits_in_10th_year‘.
         Let’s analysis the problem, we can calculate the number of fruits for each year based on the description in the question.
         Here’s a better solution:
         ‘‘‘python
         initial_fruits = 50
         num_of_fruits_in_6th_year = 3 * initial_fruits
         num_of_fruits_in_7th_year = 7 * initial_fruits
         num_of_fruits_in_9th_year = 0
         num_of_fruits_in_10th_year = 20 * initial_fruits
         num_of_fruits_in_8th_year = num_of_fruits_in_10th_year - 200
         total_fruits = (
         initial_fruits
         + num_of_fruits_in_6th_year
         + num_of_fruits_in_7th_year
         + num_of_fruits_in_8th_year
         + num_of_fruits_in_9th_year
         + num_of_fruits_in_10th_year
         )
         answer = total_fruits
         print(answer)  # Ensure the final result is explicitly printed
         ‘‘‘
         Execution: Output: Done
         answer = 2350.0

       - **Output**: 2350.0

    # Notes

    - For ambiguous questions, use multiple sources to triangulate the most accurate information.
    - For mathematical errors, iterate the correction until logical consistency is achieved.
    - Ensure that the final answer of your code is always explicitly printed using `print()`.

## Runnables

CRITIC integrates external tools to perform verification tasks:

- **[Tavily
  Search](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/tavily_search/#tool-features)(TavilySearchResults):**
  - Validates factual correctness.
  - Retrieves and processes web-based evidence.
- **[Riza Code
  Interpreter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/riza/#related)
  (ExecPython):**
  - Executes Python code to support the LLM’s mathematical reasoning.
  - Provides feedback on execution results and errors.

**Key Points**

- Tavily Search: Configured to retrieve detailed search results,
  supporting robust verification for question answering.
- RIZA Code Intperpreter: Executes Python programs to assess correctness
  and provide feedback on mathematical reasoning tasks which are
  translated into python code.
- TOOL_MAP: Organizes tools for seamless execution: we can call each
  tool by its name.

Next, we instantiate a Large Language Model.

## States

We implement the Critic Agent as outlined in Algorithm 1 of the [Critic
Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738)(Gou et al. 2024). The agent is
implemented using
[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/),
a framework that defines agents as state machines represented as graphs.

- **Nodes**: Each node in the graph is a function that takes the state
  as input and returns an updated version of the state as output.
- **Edges**: Each edge connects nodes and dictates transitions between
  them.

### State of the Critic Agent

The state of the Critic Agent contains the following attributes:

- ***p***: The system prompt.
- ***x***: The input message.
- ***y***: The entire message history, stored as a list
  \[*y*<sub>0</sub>, *y*<sub>1</sub>, ..., *y*<sub>*i*</sub>\] instead
  of just the latest output message *y*<sub>*i*</sub>. This approach
  aligns with examples such as those in the Appendix of (Gou et al.
  2024).
- ***c***: The responses of external tools (the critiques).

### Modifications to Align with Practical Implementation

Compared to the pseudo-code in Algorithm 1, we modify the state of the
Critic Agent as follows:

1.  **Message History (*y*)**: Instead of storing only the latest output
    *y*<sub>*i*</sub>, we maintain the full history of messages
    \[*y*<sub>0</sub>, *y*<sub>1</sub>, ..., *y*<sub>*i*</sub>\]. This
    change ensures richer context availability during the iterative
    process. For instance, in tasks like TriviaQA (Appendix of (Gou et
    al. 2024)), maintaining full history facilitates better verification
    and correction.
2.  **Iteration Tracking**: We store the number of iterations the agent
    has gone through the critic stage. This attribute ensures that the
    process halts after a user-defined maximum number of iterations,
    preventing infinite loops.

### Rationale for Full Message History

The choice to store the entire message history (*y*) instead of just the
latest output (*y*<sub>*i*</sub>) is demonstrated in practical
applications, such as the TriviaQA example in the Critic Paper. In this
example:

- The question requires determining *which innovation for the car was
  developed by Prince Henry of Prussia in 1911*. To answer:
  - The Critic Agent first queries information about Prince Henry of
    Prussia to identify his contributions and historical context.
  - Subsequently, the agent queries information on innovations he
    developed in 1911 to pinpoint the car-related invention.
- Retaining the full history allows the second query to reference
  outputs from the first query, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the
  iterative reasoning process.

Without full message history, the Critic Agent might lose context from
earlier tool outputs, leading to incomplete or inconsistent answers. By
maintaining all intermediate steps and critiques, the agent ensures
comprehensive and context-aware responses. This design choice is
critical for multi-step, tool-dependent tasks where earlier results
inform later reasoning.

>                   num_iterations:int=0)

*Represents the state of the Critic during execution, as defined in
Algorithm 1 of the referenced paper.*

## Nodes

The Critic Agent’s graph has two nodes,
[`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant)
and [`tools`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#tools),
which collaborate to iteratively answer the query.

- **[`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant)
  Node**:
  - **Input**: The initial question and the `Observation` (result of a
    tool invocation).
  - **Processing**:
    - The `assistant` generates a `Thought` by reasoning about whether
      the current information is sufficient to answer the question.
    - If more information is needed, the `assistant` generates an
      `Action`, specifying a tool call and its arguments (e.g., search
      query for Tavily Search or Python code for Riza Code Interpreter).
  - **Output**: A `Thought` (decision) and, if needed, an `Action` (tool
    call).
- **[`tools`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#tools)
  Node**:
  - **Input**: The `Action` generated by the
    [`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant).
  - **Execution**: Invokes the specified tool with the provided
    arguments and retrieves the result.
  - **Output**: An `Observation`, which is passed back to the
    [`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant).

#### Example (TriviaQA):

For the question *“Which innovation for the car was developed by Prince
Henry of Prussia in 1911?”*:

1.  The
    [`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant)
    node receives the query and decides to search for information about
    Henry of Prussia, generating an `Action` (search query).
2.  The [`tools`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#tools)
    node executes the search and returns the result (`Observation`) to
    the
    [`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant).
3.  The
    [`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant)
    evaluates the observation, determines that more information is
    needed, and generates another `Action` to search for innovations by
    Prince Henry.
4.  The [`tools`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#tools)
    node performs the second search, and the result allows the
    [`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant)
    to conclude the answer.

This iterative process continues until the
[`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant)
determines the answer or a termination condition is met (e.g., maximum
iterations).

#### Interaction and Graph Dynamics:

The Critic Agent operates as a state machine:

- **Nodes**: Functions that process and transform the agent’s state.
- **Edges**: Transitions between nodes based on the agent’s decisions
  (`Thought` and `Action`).

#### State Attributes as Independent Channels

In LangGraph, each attribute of the state, such as `p`, `x`, `c`, and
`y`, functions as an independent **channel** that can be updated
individually.

- **Partial Updates**: Functions operating on the state (nodes) do not
  need to return a complete state object. Instead, they can selectively
  update one or more attributes (channels) while leaving the others
  unchanged.
- **State Compilation**: During the graph compilation process, LangGraph
  ensures that all node functions output a complete state object. It
  merges the unchanged attributes with the updated ones, creating a
  seamless transition between nodes.
- **Example**: In the
  [`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant)
  node, the function only updates the `y` attribute of the state.
  Similarly, the
  [`tools`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#tools) node
  updates `c` and `num_iterations`. LangGraph handles the integration of
  these updates into the full state object.

This feature simplifies node implementation and enhances modularity, as
each node can focus solely on the attributes it directly affects.
LangGraph ensures the consistency and integrity of the full state during
execution.

## Conditional Edges

The
[`tool_call`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#tool_call)
function defines a conditional edge in the Critic Agent’s graph. This
edge determines whether the agent invokes a tool for additional
observations or concludes its execution.

- **Conditions**:
  1.  **No Pending Tool Calls**:
      - If the most recent output (`state.y[-1]`) does not contain any
        tool calls, the agent assumes the assistant node has provided a
        satisfactory result validated by the Critic.
      - The agent transitions to the `END` node, returning the result as
        the final output.
  2.  **Maximum Iterations Reached**:
      - If the number of iterations (`state.num_iterations`) equals or
        exceeds the predefined limit (`MAX_NUM_ITERATIONS`), the agent
        forcefully terminates its process to prevent infinite loops.
- **Code Logic**: \`\`\`python return END if (not
  state.y\[-1\].tool_calls) or state.num_iterations \>=
  MAX_NUM_ITERATIONS else “tools”

## Build the Graph

LangGraph models applications as **state machines**, where the system
transitions between defined states based on inputs and conditions. A
state machine is a mathematical abstraction used to represent a system
with a finite number of states, transitions, and actions. For more
details, refer to the [Wikipedia article on finite-state
machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).

This cell defines the graph for the Critic Agent, representing its
workflow as a state machine.

#### Key Components:

1.  **State Class**:
    - The
      [`CriticState`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#criticstate)
      class defines the state of the agent, storing attributes such as
      the system prompt (`p`), input (`x`), message history (`y`), tool
      responses (`c`), and the number of iterations (`num_iterations`).
2.  **Nodes**:
    - Nodes are **functions mapping a state onto a new state**. Each
      node takes a
      [`CriticState`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#criticstate)
      as input and returns an updated
      [`CriticState`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#criticstate)
      after performing a specific operation:
      - **`assistant`**: Processes the current state to generate a
        `Thought` (decision) and an `Action` (e.g., a tool call).
      - **`tools`**: Executes the specified tool action and updates the
        state with the resulting observation.
3.  **Edges**:
    - Edges are **functions on states** mapping them onto nodes. They
      dictate the control flow between them:
      - **`START → assistant`**: The graph starts at the `assistant`
        node.
      - **`assistant → tools` (Conditional Edge)**:
        - The `tool_call` function determines whether to transition to
          the `tools` node or terminate the process based on whether
          additional tool calls are needed or the iteration limit is
          reached.
      - **`tools → assistant`**: After executing a tool action, control
        flows back to the `assistant` node for further reasoning.
4.  **Graph Compilation**:
    - The graph is constructed using LangGraph’s `StateGraph` and
      compiled with `builder.compile()` to produce the executable state
      machine (`critic`).

#### Workflow:

The Critic Agent alternates between reasoning
([`assistant`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#assistant))
and tool execution
([`tools`](https://lubok-dot.github.io/agentic/critic.html#tools))
until:

1.  It produces a satisfactory result validated by the Critic, or
2.  It reaches the maximum iteration limit (`MAX_NUM_ITERATIONS`).

This design ensures iterative improvement of the response while
enforcing efficient termination when appropriate.

## Run the Agent

We evaluate the model on 5 examples each from GSM8K(Cobbe et al. 2021)
and AmbigNQ(Min et al. 2020) (Kwiatkowski et al. 2019). The
[GSM8K](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
(Grade School Math 8K) dataset is a collection of 8.5K high-quality,
linguistically diverse grade school math word problems. It is designed
to evaluate the arithmetic reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The [AmbigNQ](https://github.com/shmsw25/AmbigQA) dataset
is a collection of 14k questions derived from the NQ-open benchmark,
specifically designed to explore ambiguity in open-domain question
answering. For further details, refer to the [data utilities
documentation](./utils/01_data.html).

### Define Configuration

When executing our agent, we can specify runtime parameters using the
`config` argument in the `invoke` or `batch` methods. This argument
accepts a
[`RunnableConfig`](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.config.RunnableConfig.html)
instance to control the agent’s behavior. In this example, we set a
recursion limit of 5 to prevent the agent from calling the same node
more than five times. Additionally, we limit the agent to a maximum of
five concurrent calls to the language model (LLM) during batch

iterations, it’s important to note that exceeding this limit will cause
the agent to exit with an error, rather than completing its execution.

    The first remote control for a television was invented in 1950 by the Zenith Radio Corporation and was called "Lazy Bones." This remote was connected to the television by a long cord. Later, in 1955, Eugene Polley invented the first wireless remote control, known as the "Flash-Matic," which operated using beams of light. 

    In summary, the first remote control TV was invented in 1950.
