    "text": "This repository documents my experiments and learnings with LangGraph for implementing agentic workflows. My background in academia instilled in me a habit of understanding research papers by implementing them. As a result, this repository includes several implementations of research papers. These exercises extend beyond agentic workflows to cover various topics in mathematics and machine learning. You can find more examples on my personal blog.\nIn addition to these implementations, I have also developed several auxiliary functions, primarily for downloading well-known benchmark datasets from various sources.\nI chose nbdev for development because it automatically generates high-quality documentation. Moreover, it separates code writing from packaging, making it easy to create standalone modules. This feature is particularly useful when deploying agents in LangGraph Studio. You can develop everything within Jupyter notebooks and export Python files that can be uploaded to LangGraph Studio at no cost.\n\n\nIf you are new to using nbdev here are some useful pointers to get you started.\n\n\n# make sure agentic package is installed in development mode\n$ pip install -e .\n\n# make changes under nbs/ directory\n# ...\n\n# compile to have changes apply to agentic\n$ nbdev_prepare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall latest from the GitHub repository:\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/lubok-dot/agentic.git\n\n\n\nDocumentation can be found hosted on this GitHub repository’s pages.",

Typically, the number of days in a month is fixed, except February may vary due to leap years. The next day in a year is usually the date increased by one day unless it’s the end of the month, then the next day will be the first day of the following month. For the end of the year, the next day will be January 1st of the following year.\n##Thought Template\nStep 1: Identify the given date’s month and day number. Step 2: Check if it’s the end of the month; if so, confirm the start date of the next month. Step 3: If it’s not the end of the month, simply add one to the day number. Step 4: Pay special attention to the end of the year, ensuring the year increments."

The lines are typically in iambic pentameter, though flexibility in rhythm can be allowed for creative reasons. The given rhyme scheme dictates the end sounds of each line, ensuring a structured poetic form. Incorporating the three provided words verbatim requires strategic placement within the lines to maintain the poem’s coherence and thematic unity.\n##Thought Template\nStep 1: Identify the three words that must be included in the sonnet. Step 2: Understand the rhyme scheme “ABAB CDCD EFEF GG” and prepare a list of rhyming words that could be used. Step 3: Develop a theme or story for the sonnet that can naturally incorporate the three provided words. Step 4: Begin drafting the sonnet by writing the first quatrain (four lines) following the “ABAB” rhyme scheme, ensuring one or more of the provided words are included. Step 5: Continue with the second quatrain “CDCD,” the third quatrain “EFEF,” and finally the closing couplet “GG,” each time incorporating the provided words as needed.

For example: \n    \n    **Input Prompt**: \n    ```python \n    {prompt}\n    # TODO: Implement the logic to determine if any two numbers are closer than the threshold pass \n\n    # Add your code here to complete the function\n    ```\n    **Instructions**: \n    1. **Understand and Clarify**: Make sure you understand the task. \n    2. **Algorithm/Method Selection**: Decide on the most efficient way. \n    3. **Pseudocode Creation**: Write down the steps you will follow in pseudocode. \n    4. **Code Generation**: Translate your pseudocode into executable Python code.\n    \"\"\"\n).strip()\n\n# one-shot example\nresponse = textwrap.dedent(\n    '''\n    As a software developer, I'll follow the Chain-of-Thought approach outlined in the prompt to complete the `has_close_elements` function. Let's break it down into the four steps: \n    \n    1. **Understand and Clarify**: \n    - The task is to write a function that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer to each other than a specified threshold. \n    - The function should return `True` if such a pair exists, otherwise `False`. \n    \n    2. **Algorithm/Method Selection**: \n    - A straightforward way to solve this would be to compare each number with every other number in the list. \n    - We can use a nested loop where each number is compared to every number that comes after it in the list. \n    - The absolute difference between each pair will be calculated and compared to the threshold. \n    \n    3. **Pseudocode Creation**: \n    ```\n    function has_close_elements(numbers, threshold): \n        loop through each number in the list (i) \n            for each number, loop through the remaining numbers in the list (j) \n                if the absolute difference between numbers[i] and numbers[j] is less than or equal to the threshold \n                    return True \n    if no such pair is found, return False \n    ``` \n    \n    4. **Code Generation**: \n    - Translate the pseudocode into Python code. Only implement the function. DO NOT add any test cases or explanations. \n    Return the python implementation of the function within triple quotes. Here's a complete example: \n    ```python \n    from typing import List \n    \n    def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -&gt; bool: \n        \"\"\" \n        Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold. \n        \n        &gt;&gt;&gt; has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) \n        False \n        &gt;&gt;&gt; has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) \n        True \n        \"\"\" \n        # Loop through each number in the list \n        for i in range(len(numbers)): \n            # For each number, loop through the remaining numbers \n            for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)): \n                # If the absolute difference is less than or equal to the threshold, return True \n                if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) &lt;= threshold: \n                    return True \n                    \n        # If no such pair is found, return False \n        return False \n        ```\n'''\n).strip()\n\n\n\n\nExported source\n# Test Designer Prompt\ntester_prompt = textwrap.dedent(\n    \"\"\"\n    **Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the incomplete `{entry_point}` function.

Large Scale Test Cases**:\n    - **Objective**: Assess the function’s performance and scalability with large data samples.\n    - **Examples**:\n        ```python\n        # Test 1: Large list with predictable pattern\n        large_list = [i * 0.1 for i in range(100000)]  # Creates a list [0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 9999.9]\n        \n        # Test with a threshold where no close elements exist\n        assert (x := {entry_point}(large_list, 0.05)) == False, str(x) + ' differs from the expected output'\n        \n        # Test with a larger threshold where adjacent elements are within the threshold\n        assert (x := {entry_point}(large_list, 0.15)) == True, str(x) + ' differs from the expected output'\n        ```\n\n    **Instructions**:\n    - Implement and execute these test cases.\n    - Document any errors, inefficiencies, or unexpected behaviors observed during testing.\n    \"\"\"\n).strip()\n\n# Prompt to structure the output of the Test Designer\nstructure_test = textwrap.dedent(\n    '''\n    Extract the items of the 'Tester' Pydantic class from the previous conversation.

When performing arithmetic operations with floating-point numbers, small precision errors can occur, leading to unexpected results.\n\nTo address this, we can use the `math.modf()` function, which returns the fractional and integer parts of a floating-point number as a tuple.

You can run the tests again to verify that the function behaves as expected.\n================================ Human Message =================================\n\nFAILED TEST\n\nYour solution failed the edge test \n\n&lt;test&gt;               \nassert (x := truncate_number(1e10 + 0.9999)) == 0.9999, f\"Expected 0.9999 but got {x}\"\n&lt;test&gt;\n\nwith the error message:\n\n&lt;error&gt;\nExpected 0.9999 but got 0.9999008178710938\n&lt;error&gt;\n=============\nFAILED TEST\n\nYour solution failed the edge test \n\n&lt;test&gt;               \nassert (x := truncate_number(2.999999)) == 0.999999, f\"Expected 0.999999 but got {x}\"\n&lt;test&gt;\n\nwith the error message:\n\n&lt;error&gt;\nExpected 0.999999 but got 0.9999989999999999\n&lt;error&gt;\n=============\nFAILED TEST\n\nYour solution failed the large test \n\n&lt;test&gt;               \nlarge_floats = [1e6 + (i * 0.1) for i in range(100000)]  # Creates a list of large floats\nresults = [truncate_number(num) for num in large_floats]\nassert all(result == (i * 0.1) for i, result in zip(range(100000), results)), \"Decimal parts do not match expected values\"\n&lt;test&gt;\n\nwith the error message:\n\n&lt;error&gt;\nDecimal parts do not match expected values\n&lt;error&gt;\n\n\nLast, we access the final implementation and run it against the HumanEval test cases.\n\n# Access the final state of the graph\nstate = coder.get_state(thread)\n\n# Run tests on the final implementation\nexec(state.values[\"code\"][-1] + problem[\"test\"] +\n     f\"\\ncheck({problem['entry_point']})\")\n\nprint(f'Tests ran successful after {len(state.values[\"code\"])} iterations!')\n\nTests ran successful after 4 iterations!",

    "text": "States\nWe implement the Critic Agent as outlined in Algorithm 1 of the Critic Paper(Gou et al. 2024). The agent is implemented using LangGraph, a framework that defines agents as state machines represented as graphs.\n\nNodes: Each node in the graph is a function that takes the state as input and returns an updated version of the state as output.\nEdges: Each edge connects nodes and dictates transitions between them.\n\n\nState of the Critic Agent\nThe state of the Critic Agent contains the following attributes:\n\n\\(p\\): The system prompt.\n\\(x\\): The input message.\n\\(y\\): The entire message history, stored as a list \\([y_0, y_1, ..., y_i]\\) instead of just the latest output message \\(y_i\\). This approach aligns with examples such as those in the Appendix of (Gou et al. 2024).\n\\(c\\): The responses of external tools (the critiques).\n\n\n\nModifications to Align with Practical Implementation\nCompared to the pseudo-code in Algorithm 1, we modify the state of the Critic Agent as follows:\n\nMessage History (\\(y\\)): Instead of storing only the latest output \\(y_i\\), we maintain the full history of messages \\([y_0, y_1, ..., y_i]\\). This change ensures richer context availability during the iterative process. For instance, in tasks like TriviaQA (Appendix of (Gou et al. 2024)), maintaining full history facilitates better verification and correction.\nIteration Tracking: We store the number of iterations the agent has gone through the critic stage. This attribute ensures that the process halts after a user-defined maximum number of iterations, preventing infinite loops.\n\n\n\nRationale for Full Message History\nThe choice to store the entire message history (\\(y\\)) instead of just the latest output (\\(y_i\\)) is demonstrated in practical applications, such as the TriviaQA example in the Critic Paper. In this example:\n\nThe question requires determining which innovation for the car was developed by Prince Henry of Prussia in 1911. To answer:\n\nThe Critic Agent first queries information about Prince Henry of Prussia to identify his contributions and historical context.\nSubsequently, the agent queries information on innovations he developed in 1911 to pinpoint the car-related invention.\n\nRetaining the full history allows the second query to reference outputs from the first query, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the iterative reasoning process.\n\nWithout full message history, the Critic Agent might lose context from earlier tool outputs, leading to incomplete or inconsistent answers. By maintaining all intermediate steps and critiques, the agent ensures comprehensive and context-aware responses. This design choice is critical for multi-step, tool-dependent tasks where earlier results inform later reasoning.\n\nsource\n\n\nCriticState\n\n CriticState (p:langchain_core.messages.system.SystemMessage,\n              x:langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage,\n              y:list[langchain_core.messages.base.BaseMessage]=[],\n              c:list[langchain_core.messages.tool.ToolMessage]=[],\n              num_iterations:int=0)\n\nRepresents the state of the Critic during execution, as defined in Algorithm 1 of the referenced paper.",

Instead, they can selectively update one or more attributes (channels) while leaving the others unchanged.\nState Compilation: During the graph compilation process, LangGraph ensures that all node functions output a complete state object. It merges the unchanged attributes with the updated ones, creating a seamless transition between nodes.\nExample: In the assistant node, the function only updates the y attribute of the state. Similarly, the tools node updates c and num_iterations. LangGraph handles the integration of these updates into the full state object.\n\nThis feature simplifies node implementation and enhances modularity, as each node can focus solely on the attributes it directly affects.

While the recursion limit serves to cap the number of iterations, it’s important to note that exceeding this limit will cause the agent to exit with an error, rather than completing its execution.\n\nconfig = RunnableConfig(recursion_limit=5, max_concurrency=5)\n\n\n\nGSM8K\n\ngsm8k = [\n    {\n        \"question\": \"Janet\\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

This repository stores high-level thought-templates distilled from prior problem-solving processes. These templates are retrieved and adapted for diverse tasks, eliminating the need to design reasoning structures anew.\nThree Components\n\nProblem-Distiller: Responsible for extracting key information and constraints from tasks.\nMeta-Buffer: A lightweight memory storing thought-templates, which can span across various categories and domains. While six categories are mentioned in the paper (e.g., text comprehension, mathematical reasoning), the framework is not inherently restricted to this classification or number.\nBuffer-Manager: Dynamically updates the Meta-Buffer by distilling new templates as tasks are solved, ensuring the memory evolves with experience.\n\nAdvantages\n\nImproved Accuracy: By adapting templates to different tasks, BoT achieves precise and reliable reasoning.\nEfficiency: Stored templates allow LLMs to bypass complex multi-query reasoning, streamlining the process.\nRobustness: The generalized reasoning framework ensures consistent performance across a variety of tasks.",
