\##Task Description

When given a list of numbers, try to utilize 4 basic mathematical
operations (+-\*/) to get a target number.

\##Thought Template

Listing 1: Python template

``` python
from itertools import permutations, product

def perform_operation(a, b, operation):
    # Define the operation logic (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.).
    pass

def evaluate_sequence(sequence, operations):
    # Apply operations to the sequence and check if the result meets the criteria.
    pass

def generate_combinations(elements, operations):
    # Generate all possible combinations of elements and operations.
    pass

def format_solution(sequence, operations):
    # Format the sequence and operations into a human-readable string.
    pass

def find_solution(input_elements, target_result):
    # Data Input Handling
    # Validate and preprocess input data if necessary.

    # Core Algorithm Logic
    for sequence in permutations(input_elements):
        for operation_combination in generate_combinations(sequence, operations):
            try:
                if evaluate_sequence(sequence, operation_combination) == target_result:
                    # Data Output Formatting
                    return format_solution(sequence, operation_combination)
            except Exception as e:
                # Error Handling
                # Handle specific exceptions that may occur during evaluation.
                continue
    # If no solution is found after all iterations, return a default message.
    return "No solution found."

# Example usage:
input_elements = [1, 7, 10, 3]
target_result = 24
print(find_solution(input_elements, target_result))
```
