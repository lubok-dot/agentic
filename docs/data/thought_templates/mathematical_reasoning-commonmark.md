Solve an quadratic equation of the form
*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0 considering any situations.

\##Solution Description

To solve any quadratic equation of the form
*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0, we can follow a general approach
based on the method described. Here is the structured template for
solving such equations:

Step 1: Calculate the Discriminant

- Compute the discriminant *D* using the formula
  *D* = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*.

Step 2: Determine the Nature of the Roots

- If *D* \> 0, the equation has two distinct real roots.
- If *D* = 0, the equation has exactly one real root (also known as a
  repeated or double root).
- If *D* \< 0, the equation has two complex roots.

Step 3: Compute the Roots

- For *D* ≥ 0, calculate the roots using the formula
  $$x = −b \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{D}}{2a}\\ $$
- For *D* \< 0, calculate the real and imaginary parts of the complex
  roots using the formula
  $$x = \dfrac{-b}{2a} \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{-D}}{2a} i\\ ,$$
  where iis the imaginary unit.
