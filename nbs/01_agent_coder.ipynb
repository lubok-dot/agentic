    "AgentCoder is a multi-agent framework designed to enhance code generation by leveraging three distinct roles to streamline the coding and validation process. This implementation is directly derived from the paper *\"AgentCoder: Multi-Agent Code Generation with Effective Testing and Self-Optimization\"*, with some minor modifications to the prompts to optimize its functionality within LangGraph.\n",

    "### **Key Features of AgentCoder**\n",
    "1. **Three Roles**: \n",
    "   - **Programmer**: Responsible for generating code based on requirements.\n",
    "   - **Test Designer**: Generates comprehensive, independent test cases without being influenced by the program code. The test cases cover basic ones, edge cases, and large scale test cases, testing for performance.\n",
    "   - **Test Executor**: A program (not an LLM persona) that runs the tests and provides feedback for further code refinement.\n",
    "2. **Independent Test Creation**: Ensures objectivity and enhances the reliability of generated tests.\n",
    "3. **Iterative Improvement**: Refines code through multiple iterations based on test feedback until all tests pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Notebook Objectives**\n",
    "- Illustrate the implementation of the AgentCoder framework using LangGraph.\n",
    "- Showcase the use of **Checkpointer (Memory)** in LangGraph to access the state of an executed graph.\n",
    "- Direct derivation of the implementation from the research paper, with minor modifications to the prompts."

    "    - The task is to write a function that checks if any two numbers in a given list are closer to each other than a specified threshold. \n",

      "Let's break down the task of implementing the `below_zero` function using the Chain-of-Thought approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understand and Clarify**: \n",
      "   - We need to track the balance of a bank account that starts at zero.\n",
      "   - The input is a list of integers representing deposits (positive numbers) and withdrawals (negative numbers).\n",
      "   - The function should return `True` if the balance ever falls below zero during the operations; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Algorithm/Method Selection**: \n",
      "   - We can iterate through the list of operations, maintaining a running total of the balance.\n",
      "   - After each operation, we check if the balance is below zero.\n",
      "   - This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pseudocode Creation**: \n",
      "```\n",
      "function below_zero(operations):\n",
      "    initialize balance to 0\n",
      "    for each operation in operations:\n",
      "        add operation to balance\n",
      "        if balance is less than 0:\n",
      "            return True\n",
      "    return False\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Code Generation**: \n",
      "- Now, let's translate the pseudocode into Python code. Here's the complete implementation of the function:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from typing import List\n",
      "\n",
      "def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n",
      "    \"\"\" \n",
      "    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n",
      "    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, and\n",
      "    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])\n",
      "    False\n",
      "    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])\n",
      "    True\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    # Initialize the balance to zero\n",
      "    balance = 0\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Iterate through each operation in the list\n",
      "    for operation in operations:\n",
      "        # Update the balance with the current operation\n",

Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, and\\n    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.\\n    \\n    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])\\n    False\\n    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])\\n    True\\n    \"\"\"\\n    # Initialize the balance to zero\\n    balance = 0\\n    \\n    # Iterate through each operation\\n    for operation in operations:\\n        # Update the balance\\n        balance += operation\\n        \\n        # Check if the balance falls below zero\\n        if balance < 0:\\n            return True  # Return True if balance is below zero\\n    \\n    # If the loop completes without the balance going below zero, return False\\n    return False\\n```\\n\\n### Key Points:\\n1. **Initialization**: The balance starts at zero.\\n2. **Iteration**: We loop through each operation in the list.\\n3. **Balance Update**: For each operation, we update the balance.\\n4. **Check for Below Zero**: After updating the balance, we check if it has fallen below zero. If it has, we return `True`.\\n5. **Final Return**: If we finish the loop without the balance going below zero, we return `False`.\\n\\n### Testing the Function:\\nTo test the function, you can run the following assertions in a Python environment:\\n\\n```python\\nassert (x := below_zero([1, 2, 3])) == False, f\"Expected False, got {x}\"\\nassert (x := below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])) == True, f\"Expected True, got {x}\"\\nassert (x := below_zero([])) == False, f\"Expected False, got {x}\"\\nassert (x := below_zero([-1])) == True, f\"Expected True, got {x}\"\\nassert (x := below_zero([5, 10, -20, 5])) == True, f\"Expected True, got {x}\"\\nassert (x := below_zero([10, 20, 30])) == False, f\"Expected False, got {x}\"\\nassert (x := below_zero([10, 20, -15])) == False, f\"Expected False, got {x}\"\\nassert (x := below_zero([10, -15])) == True, f\"Expected True, got {x}\"\\nassert (x := below_zero([1] * 1000 + [-1001])) == True, f\"Expected True, got {x}\"\\nlarge_deposits = [100] * 1000000  # One million deposits of 100\\nassert (x := below_zero(large_deposits)) == False, f\"Expected False, got {x}\"\\nlarge_operations = [1] * 999999 + [-1000000]  # One million operations, last is a large withdrawal\\nassert (x := below_zero(large_operations)) == True, f\"Expected True, got {x}\"\\nalternating_operations = [1, -1] * 500000  # One million operations, alternating\\nassert (x := below_zero(alternating_operations)) == False, f\"Expected False, got {x}\"\\ntouch_zero_operations = [1] * 500000 + [-1] * 500000  # Balance will touch zero but not go below\\nassert (x := below_zero(touch_zero_operations)) == False, f\"Expected False, got {x}\"\\nlarge_negative = [1] * 999999 + [-1000001]  # One million operations, last is a large withdrawal\\nassert (x := below_zero(large_negative)) == True, f\"Expected True, got {x}\"\\n```\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nIf you continue to experience issues, please check the environment where the tests are being executed. The function itself is logically sound and should not produce any syntax errors or index out of range errors. If the problem persists, consider running the tests in a different Python environment or IDE to isolate the issue.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 972, 'prompt_tokens': 6159, 'total_tokens': 7131, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 4608}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_0aa8d3e20b', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-55a29757-6e8d-4a3f-8281-4381dae9d46d-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6159, 'output_tokens': 972, 'total_tokens': 7131, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 4608}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}),\n",
