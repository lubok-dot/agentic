##Task Description

The task involves analyzing a table with various attributes of penguins, such as name, age, height, and weight, and answering questions about these attributes. The table may be updated with new entries, and additional context or comparisons may be provided in natural language.

##Solution Description

To accurately answer questions about the penguins’ attributes, one must be able to interpret the data presented in tabular form, understand any additional information provided in natural language, and apply logical reasoning to identify the correct attribute based on the question asked.

##Thought Template
Step 1: Parse the initial table, extracting the header information and each penguin’s attributes into a structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries).
Step 2: Read and integrate any additional natural language information that updates or adds to the table, ensuring the data remains consistent.
Step 3: Identify the attribute in question (e.g., oldest penguin, heaviest penguin) and the corresponding column in the table.
Step 4: Apply logical reasoning to compare the relevant attribute across all entries to find the correct answer (e.g., the highest age for the oldest penguin).
Step 5: Select the answer from the provided options that matches the result of the logical comparison.
