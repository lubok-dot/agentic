##Task Description

Given a specific date and an event, such as a holiday or historical event, determine the
following date.

##Solution Description

To determine the next date, we need to consider the structure of the calendar, the number of
days in each month, and whether it’s a leap year. Typically, the number of days in a month
is fixed, except February may vary due to leap years. The next day in a year is usually the
date increased by one day unless it’s the end of the month, then the next day will be the first
day of the following month. For the end of the year, the next day will be January 1st of the
following year.

##Thought Template

Step 1: Identify the given date’s month and day number.
Step 2: Check if it’s the end of the month; if so, confirm the start date of the next month.
Step 3: If it’s not the end of the month, simply add one to the day number.
Step 4: Pay special attention to the end of the year, ensuring the year increments.
